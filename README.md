# A Country GDP Vs. its Fertility and Mortality Rates

I want to see whether there is a relationship between a country GDP and its fertility and mortality rates. I recreated this project from my CMSE class but improved it by apply a fundamental data science project's outline to get me farmiliar with: data exploration, data manipulation stages.

## Background and Motivation

I stumbled across this question when I was studying in my social science class about the prosperity of different countries. Especially, we looked at three types of nation: core nations, semi-periphery nations, and periphery nations. 

To summarize, a core nation is one that has strong power, both politically and economically (such as the United States). While the periphery nation is a complete opposite. Hence, the semi-periphery nation is the one in between the two groups. 

After learning about the differences between the three types, I started to form my curiosity around whether there are any trends that lead to the differences the way it is.

## Prerequisites
Python Version: 3.7.4

Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, random

## Project Outline
1. Project planning: determine the necessary variables to compute statistical analysis to answer our question
    - List of variables: _GDP_ (Gross Domestic Product), _fertility rate_ (average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime), _mortality rate_ (can be called death rate; is a measure of the number of deaths in a particular population)
2. Data exploration: read the dataset in to get farmiliar with columns and values
3. Data manipulation (data cleaning): modify the dataframes, delete null and unnecessary data values, extracting data from original to cleaned csv files
4. Regression model: perform polynomial regression and caculate mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R**2)

As I am doing my research for the data source, I find the page [World Bank Group](https://www.worldbank.org/). Based on my findings, they have a very accountable data bank that I can use for my project. I also do some checking to see if the data is clean and whether there is an empty/ incomplete data point. Although there are incomplete data, I does not seem to affect my analysis too much. Here are the sources for data I collected:

* [The World Bank Group: GDP (current US$)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?most_recent_year_desc=false&view=map&year=2018)

* [The World Bank Group: Fertility rate, total (births per woman)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN/)

* [The World Bank Group: Death rate, crude (per 1,000 people)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.cdrt.in)
